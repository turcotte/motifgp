# MotifGP 0.1.1

## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains the source code for the software system
MotifGP. This computer program takes as input a set of unaligned DNA
sequences and produces a set of sequence motifs.

## HISTORY

MotifGP was developed at the University of Ottawa by Manuel
Belmadani under the supervision of Marcel Turcotte.

## PUBLICATIONS

The project is documented by the following publications.
